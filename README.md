# Anamoly-detection-HDP-clustering-technique
Anamoly detection in traffic videos using HDP clustering method and Gaussian Naive bayes Classifier

File- Full code HDP directly giving motion vectors, is jupyter notebook file. Here for HDP clustering technique input we will provide is the magnitude of the history obtained from optocal flow.

File- Full code HDP giving codebook formed by binning, is jupyter notebook file. Here in this file HDP clustering input is the codebook formed by quantizing the history into 8 bins.

both files. In cell 6,we have to provide the input path to the video and annotation file(used for labeling the clips).
Video used as input is IDIAP junction dataset(traffic-junction.avi).

Sample annotation file also provided. (Note: annotation should be in the format provided)
